## How the TSC Works

### RFC Process
All specification changes must go through the RFC (Request for Comments) process:
1. Community proposes change in `wekaou-rfc`
2. Discussion period (minimum 14 days)
3. TSC votes (simple majority)
4. If approved, change is merged to specification

### Meetings
- **Frequency**: Monthly (first Thursday)
- **Duration**: 90 minutes
- **Open Attendance**: Anyone can observe
- **Public Records**: Notes published within 48 hours

### Working Groups
The TSC charters Working Groups for domain-specific work. See [../working-groups/](../working-groups/).
