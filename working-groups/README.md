## What are Working Groups?

Working Groups (WGs) are focused teams chartered by the TSC to advance specific aspects of the WEKAOU ecosystem.

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Focused Scope**: Each WG has a clear, bounded mission
- **TSC Oversight**: Chartered and supervised by the Technical Steering Committee
- **Autonomous Operation**: Work independently within their charter
- **Community-Driven**: Open participation for qualified members
