## Mission

Develop and maintain domain-specific profiles, artifacts, and best practices for applying WEKAOU in specialized contexts.

3. **Profile Template**: Reusable structure for future domains

### Phase 2 (Months 7-12)
4. **3 Additional Profiles**: Healthcare, Finance, Manufacturing
5. **Validation Suite**: Domain-specific compliance tests
